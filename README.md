## What's the point?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

Using [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) to make a homepage for my projects, future and past. For now, the website is as unimpressive as the projects that are displayed. The idea behind the website is that it will evolve alongside my ability as a programmer.

## What's next?
